Hola nerds!
This is Amritansh, a little guy from IIT-BHU-CSE-2017, about to make his first commit for the first assignment for the second week of CSOC. Cheers!
Wanna know about me?
Well, I'm a coding enthusiast(I love lolcode :P) and a tech freak. And I guess thats enough for the first commit. See ya.
